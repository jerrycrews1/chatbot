Surfing was so much fun in source. So many hours wasted playing death runs and mini games, but nothing like a relaxing shot at getting through bob II faster than my friends. 
Rats. Well she'll still probably die before you.

Do you have any specific feats of Book Legolas? I agree Legolas is good, but is he really THAT good?
I always think of the Uncle Drew videos when this comes up. Seeing them play normal people is eye opening.
You'll have to ask the boyfriend about that. ;) he's been wanting an addition. ;p
Up voted because you cared enough to reply about him noticing that he said die
In that case you may do well to swallow your pride. You'll thank yourself for it later. With your disabilities interfering with other goals you have such as your education you could really use the help.
Bitch I only teach shouts to worthy people OOOOOOOOOOHHHH
I already got a few things spoiled here and there but I'm not really one that is bothered that much by spoilers.
It's just highlighting how complicated it is because calling me a European or an African are both simultaneously correct and incorrect.

His discussions with Black wall are really fantastic, too. Actually, Blackwall's banter with any party member past a certain point in his story is just perfect.
Consensus in that thread seemed to favor Kratos over Chief.

It's the podium that does it for me.
It's barren! there's not a lot here, (I'm living along the border, so it's actually pretty much in the boonies).  But the pay is much nicer than Ontario ;).

What sport? Usually athletes like to bulk hard in the offseason and cut shortly before the season, if I'm not mistaken. Something to consider.
During... Kinda. I started watching it, got to episode 4 or so, and decided 'Fuck that, I will go and get it'. And so I did. Finished it in two good sittings.  
ChefTap (play store). It's really quite good at extracting recipes from random web sites and putting them in a standard format. It preserves the link too, so you can quickly access the original if necessary.
Yeah its too fucking simple to chargeback over paypal. Just say someone else used your account or call your bank. It is bullshit to us sellers who are legitimate and deliver the goods only to have our money and items lost.
IIRC, it is an old NES game about dodging arrows so you can rape a native woman tied to a pole. Yeah. Pretty 'niche' if you ask me.

Nolan Christ. Is this guy one of us?
In fact, forget the tower!
Yeah. The draft after he left we spent two first rounders on o line. Granted they we're some of our best picks but still.
Agreed. That's particularly why I like overcast days. When I cannot tell what time it is naturally I seem to have a better outlook and more energy.
Awesome! That's exactly what I have, 115 gr. Yeah that's what the guy at the range counter told me. He's like 'dude, it's a glock. Just go shoot it you're not gonna hurt it.' newlinechar  newlinechar Have a safe new years, thanks for the reply.

What this guy said, it may not be mutual. But the worst that will happen is you might feel a bit down, but she'll be happier for it. It's nice knowing someone likes you.    Hell, maybe she likes you too,  that'd make her even happier.

He is NHL worthy, barely, but Panik should be in the lineup before him, I think.

Better to spend money to prevent someone else getting content then letting other channels build up MLS.  Same garbage they pulled with NASCAR.
